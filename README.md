A simple tool that sends a push notification whether user wants to delete a taken screenshot or not. If the user clicks on the push notification it deletes the file instantly. It is mainly useful when we want to instantly delete after sending picture to someone instead of going to the file manager to find and delete the file.
Works on windows only!
